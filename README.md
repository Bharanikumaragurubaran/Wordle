## Wordle
Developed Wordle game using Python (from scratch)

## Setup
To run this program, download and save df_words.csv and wordle.py in same folder and proceed to run .py file

## Necessary packages to install
1. Pandas
2. Colorama

## Motivation
I used to play Wordle game on a regular basis and I liked it very much!
But we can play Wordle only one time per day therefore I thought what if I build my own Wordle game using Python.
TBH process of developing Wordle game is very much exciting than playing it from online :)

## Use of Pandas
Here is used Pandas to import and use a dataset from Kagle
Dataset had various 5 letter meaningful words which I used to populate in the game.
